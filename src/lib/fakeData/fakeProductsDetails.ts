      "Handwoven with coarse mountain wool that becomes softer with use, this traditional fouta blanket carries the vibrant energy of the Atlas Mountains. The bold saffron stripes contrast with stark black and natural white, creating rhythmic patterns that shift in different light.",
      "Each thread holds the subtle variations of hand-spun wool - you'll find tiny irregularities that testify to its artisanal origin. The generous size (200x150cm) makes it perfect for chilly evenings or as a statement textile in your home."
    ],
    "whyMade": "Idir wove this fouta during the spring shearing season when wool is richest. The saffron represents the sun that warms Kesra's highlands, the black signifies volcanic mountains, and the undyed white honors the sheep that sustain Berber communities. This pattern is traditionally gifted to newlyweds for fertility blessings.",
